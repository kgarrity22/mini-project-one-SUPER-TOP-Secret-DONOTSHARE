        <h1>Good Visualization Designs</h1>
        <img src="assets/TeenPregnancy.svg" alt="Teen Pregnancy" width="400" height="400">
        <p> This visualization utilizes the idiom of parallel coordinates to demonstrate the decrease in US teen
            pregnancy rate that occurred between 2008 - 2018. Teen pregnancy rates are encoded as points along two axes
            that represent each year, respectively. The rates are also presented as whole numbers since the
            visualization clarifies “births per 1,000 females aged 19-15” in its header. This is better for the audience
            -- it is far easier to conceptualize 78 whole humans for every 1000 than .0078 for every one. Lines are used
            to easily identify the trend of decreasing rates between years. The position of a point, a magnitude
            channel, encodes how many teen pregnancies occurred (per 100 females aged 15-19) in that particular year.
            Various hues of color, an identity channel, are used to encode race data: points representing birth rates of
            a particular race, and lines connecting those points, are all a particular color. Position and color work
            together to call attention to the difference in rates not only over time, but also during the same year. The
            axes do take advantage of slightly unaligned spatial position--as you can see the “27”s are not aligned.
            However, this seems to have been done for clarity so that the extremely low rate of 4 was not at the
            absolute minimum, which it probably would have given the size of the points. The numbers appear to be scaled
            accurately outside of this inconsistency. Going further, the visualization also makes use of whitespace on
            the right side to include the percent decrease in rates. Their position and color also encode race data.
        </p>    
        <p> Anyone from policy makers to parents might be interested in the story this visualization has to tell. Its
            message is clear: regardless of race, teen pregnancy rates have decreased substantially within that 10 year
            period. This visualization is good for a variety of reasons. The trend it is trying to show is extremely
            clear. It is well labeled, not cluttered, and uses an aesthetically pleasing color scheme. More importantly,
            this visualization is also enlightening. Teen pregnancy, a tremendous source of emotional, financial, and
            physical hardship, is now much less frequent in the US. Going further, even though it continues to affect
            different races disproportionately, the gap has closed significantly in just 10 years. While this
            visualization does not provide any answers as to why this happened, it is extremely clear that US teen
            pregnancy rates have decreased, regardless of race, and serves as an indicator of progress for our society.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/WageGap.png" alt="Wage Gap" width="500">
        <p>
            This visualization makes use of the bar chart idiom to bring attention to the wage gap that exists between male and
            female teaching salaries in England. The quantitative value, teacher salary (in UK pound sterling), is encoded by the
            aligned horizontal spatial position of the bars. Instead of one categorical key attributes there are two: dividing the
            data based primarily on sex and then by teacher type. Vertical position separates the category of teacher, each group of
            salaries identified by a mark--a teal line. Sex is encoded by the bars’ distinct hues of color, pink for female and grey
            for male. In the whitespace to the right of the bar chart, the actual percent differences are arranged in list
            alignment. The combination of their position and teal background notes that they identify the wage gap of each
            particular teaching category. This is a good visualization because it allows the audience to easily compare values. The
            visualization is enlightening because it magnifies a societal shortcoming. Its intended audience could be the general
            public, or potentially lawmakers who should become inspired to implement change. It’s message is clear and its question
            is simple: why are male teachers paid on average 7.4% more than women if they are occupying the same positions? The
            visualization has a crisp design, an aesthetically pleasing color palette, salient use of length and color, and is not
            misleading but informative. This easy to comprehend visualization directly addresses a problem in society.

        <h1>Bad Visualization Designs</h1>
        <h2>Weather Design</h2>
        <a href=""><img src="assets/bad-forecast.jpg" alt="Bad Forecast Visualization" width="300" height="300"></a>
        <p> We chose this as one of our examples of bad design for a number of reasons but primarily because a lot of
            the data
            encoded in this chart is misleading. This visualization is intended to reach anybody watching the news and
            convey
            information about the weather during the current day. It attempts to do so by encoding the weather data in a
            bar chart,
            using both line marks and spatial regions to encode the temperature and labeled icons to convey the
            percentage chance of
            rain. For example, the chart is labeled “Hour by Hour Forecast.” However, when you look at the labels on the
            x-axis, it
            is clear that bars are labeled in two hour increments rather than hour increments. Additionally, there is no
            y-axis so
            it is not possible to know what attribute the creators of this chart intended to encode with the bar height.
            However,
            the display suggests that they intended to encode the temperature data with the line mark at the bar height.
            If this is
            what the intention was, then the graph is very misleading because while the first two bars are labeled with
            the same
            temperature, they have different heights. Furthermore, the second and third bar are the same height, but
            different
            temperatures. The last two bars in the chart predict temperatures of 51º and 50º respectively, but the bar
            showing 50º
            is shorter than the bar showing 51º. Another issue with this chart is that both the bars for the 11 and the
            1pm hours
            are not labeled. Similarly, only some of the bars have predictions for oncoming rain. </p>
        <h2>Play Ball Design</h2>
        <img src="assets/Play_Ball!.png" alt="Play Ball bad vis" width="300" height="600">
        <p>The original version of this visualization is meant to display how each Major League Baseball team ranks for
            specific hitting and pitching statistics. Using the channel of length for its point/line marks as a way to
            display these rankings. The longer the line the higher the team is ranked for that specific stat.
            The visualization compares ten statistics for hitting, and ten statistics for pitching, displaying these
            lines in a circle. The pitching and hitting statistics are separated based on color, with blue being hitting
            and pink being pitching -- taking use of a color channel. While the visualization may be interesting to look
            at (taking advantage of the beauty aspect), it is actually ineffective and not functional in truly comparing
            teams. By looking at the visualization it is hard to compare teams side by side -- the teams are even sorted
            alphabetically rather than by winning percentage. Using this visualization we are not able to get the full
            picture as to which team is performing best. </p>
        <a href="https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/mlb-rankings?tab=viz-of-the-day&type=viz-of-the-day">Play Ball
            Visualization</a>
        <p></p>
        <img src="assets/IMG_7995.jpg" alt="Remade Vis" width="400" height="500">
        <p>In our new visualization we created a spider graph. In this visualization, we created two separate graphs,
            one for hitting statistics and one for pitching statistics -- this way we can compare these statistics on
            their own. Each corner on the graph represents a different statistic. We also included a filter which would
            allow us to select the teams we want to compare. For our marks we are utilizing points to indicate the
            rankings for each statistic, and areas to indicate the overall performance of all of the teams (taking into
            account all of the statistics). In terms of channel, we use a color channel to encode different teams, and
            an area channel to show overall performance of a team.

            Our new visualization makes it easier to make direct comparisons between teams, increasing its
            functionality compared to the original visualization. By looking at the area of the graph we can
            determine which team has the best statistics. For example in our hitting chart we see that Team 1 has a
            higher area than Team 2, indicating that Team 1 ranks higher in its statistics and theoretically is the
            better
            team.

        <h2>COVID-19 Design</h2>
        <img src="assets/BadCOVID.png" alt="Bad COVID-19 Visualization" width="400" height="200">

        <p> The original design as seen above is not an effective method of representing any sort of COVID-19 data.
            Alabama Public Health released this graphic towards the middle of May, and it is clear to see they do not
            utilize any channels other than colors. The colors are each assigned to a separate category, with red
            attached to
            “Laboratory-confirmed cases”, green attached to “Total hospitalizations”, orange attached to “Total Tested”,
            and blue
            attached to “COVID-19 Deaths”. The data of the visualization is also completely unclear, as we do not know
            if these numbers apply
            to the entire Alabama population or per a certain subset of the population.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/alab.png" alt="Bad COVID-19 Visualization" width="400" height="550">
        <p>
            Our newest visualization can easily improve this design. We will be using a heat map, in which the outline
            of Alabama
            will be separated by county lines in order to separate the numbers into a digestible amount. Additionally,
            we will be
            starting with a new data field in which we track the average weekly cases per 100,000 people. Having this as
            the main filter
            will allow for the enlightenment of the COVID-19 situation to be seen. If viewers can see that daily cases
            are decreasing, they
            will feel not only enlightened with information, but much more hopeful for the future of their state. We
            will incorporate a filter in order to s
            witch between the various other categories, such as “Deaths”, “Laboratory Confirmed Cases”, etc. The main
            mark in our visualization will be the lines
            representing the counties, helping to increase the clarity of the visualization for the view. For our
            channel, we will be utilizing a color gradient in order
            to show the difference in numbers, for example in “Average daily cases per 100,000 people in the past week”.
            The gradient includes number markings in order to
            offer baselines for interpreting the gradient.
