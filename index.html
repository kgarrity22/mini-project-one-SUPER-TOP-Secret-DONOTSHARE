            <p> This visualization utilizes the idiom of parallel coordinates to demonstrate the decrease in US teen
                pregnancy rate that occurred between 2008 - 2018. Teen pregnancy rates are encoded as points along two axes
                that represent each year, respectively. The rates are also presented as whole numbers since the
                visualization clarifies “births per 1,000 females aged 19-15” in its header. This is better for the audience
                -- it is far easier to conceptualize 78 whole humans for every 1000 than .0078 for every one. Lines are used
                to easily identify the trend of decreasing rates between years. The position of a point, a magnitude
                channel, encodes how many teen pregnancies occurred (per 100 females aged 15-19) in that particular year.
                Various hues of color, an identity channel, are used to encode race data: points representing birth rates of
                a particular race, and lines connecting those points, are all a particular color. Position and color work
                together to call attention to the difference in rates not only over time, but also during the same year. The
                axes do take advantage of slightly unaligned spatial position--as you can see the “27”s are not aligned.
                However, this seems to have been done for clarity so that the extremely low rate of 4 was not at the
                absolute minimum, which it probably would have given the size of the points. The numbers appear to be scaled
                accurately outside of this inconsistency. Going further, the visualization also makes use of whitespace on
                the right side to include the percent decrease in rates. Their position and color also encode race data.

                    clear. It is well labeled, not cluttered, and uses an aesthetically pleasing color scheme. More importantly,
                    this visualization is also enlightening. Teen pregnancy, a tremendous source of emotional, financial, and
                    physical hardship, is now much less frequent in the US. Going further, even though it continues to affect
                    different races disproportionately, the gap has closed significantly in just 10 years. While this
                    visualization does not provide any answers as to why this happened, it is extremely clear that US teen
                    pregnancy rates have decreased, regardless of race, and serves as an indicator of progress for our society.

                    This visualization makes use of the bar chart idiom to bring attention to the wage gap that exists between male and
                    female teaching salaries in England. The quantitative value, teacher salary (in UK pound sterling), is encoded by the
                    aligned horizontal spatial position of the bars. Instead of one categorical key attributes there are two: dividing the
                    data based primarily on sex and then by teacher type. Vertical position separates the category of teacher, each group of
                    salaries identified by a mark--a teal line. Sex is encoded by the bars’ distinct hues of color, pink for female and grey
                    for male. In the whitespace to the right of the bar chart, the actual percent differences are arranged in list
                    alignment. The combination of their position and teal background notes that they identify the wage gap of each
                    particular teaching category. This is a good visualization because it allows the audience to easily compare values. The
                    visualization is enlightening because it magnifies a societal shortcoming. Its intended audience could be the general
                    public, or potentially lawmakers who should become inspired to implement change. It’s message is clear and its question
                    is simple: why are male teachers paid on average 7.4% more than women if they are occupying the same positions? The
                    visualization has a crisp design, an aesthetically pleasing color palette, salient use of length and color, and is not
                    misleading but informative. This easy to comprehend visualization directly addresses a problem in society.

                    This visualization uses the boxplot idiom to answer the question “is it expensive to travel on weekends?”
                    The horizontal axis encodes day of the week, the categorical data, and the summary statistics for the prices
                    lie within the separate regions of space. The vertical axis provides a scale for the quantitative data,
                    average price, encoded in each boxplot. The boxplots are comprised of the three most common marks: lines
                    which denote the lower 5th and upper 95th percentiles, points that encode outliers that fall beyond those
                    percentiles, and areas (boxes) that contain the interquartile range from the 25th percentile on the floor of
                    the box to the 75th on the roof. The color red is used to draw attention to this range. The teal line,
                    another mark contained within the box, represents the median, or 50th percentile. The position of the teal
                    line, as well as the box as a whole, is indicative of how much it costs on average to travel on a particular
                    day of the week. The further up it is, the more pricey. These graphs also help the audience, which in this
                    case is travelers hoping to identify the day of the week to book transportation, identify the skew in the
                    data’s distribution. The skew is identified as the larger side of the box relative to the median. It also
                    includes an uncommon addition- every single datapoint appears visible as a point within its cateorgial
                    region, however they are almost completely translucent. Points that are close to one another are overlaid
                    and increase each other’s saturation, bringing the audience’s attention to these data clusters. This good
                    visualization clearly shows that it is in fact more expensive to travel on weekends. It shows that the
                    average and interquartile range of transportation price is higher on Friday and Saturday than any other day
                    of the week. Even though it is plain, the visualization is truthful, functional, beautiful, and insightful.
                    With this data travelers can easily identify days of the week in which it is more advantageous to book
                    transportation.

            <div class="text-box">

            <p> We chose this as one of our examples of bad design for a number of reasons but primarily because a lot of
                the data
                encoded in this chart is misleading. This visualization is intended to reach anybody watching the news and
                convey
                information about the weather during the current day. It attempts to do so by encoding the weather data in a
                bar chart,
                using both line marks and spatial regions to encode the temperature and labeled icons to convey the
                percentage chance of
                rain. For example, the chart is labeled “Hour by Hour Forecast.” However, when you look at the labels on the
                x-axis, it
                is clear that bars are labeled in two hour increments rather than hour increments. Additionally, there is no
                y-axis so
                it is not possible to know what attribute the creators of this chart intended to encode with the bar height.
                However,
                the display suggests that they intended to encode the temperature data with the line mark at the bar height.
                If this is
                what the intention was, then the graph is very misleading because while the first two bars are labeled with
                the same
                temperature, they have different heights. Furthermore, the second and third bar are the same height, but
                different
                temperatures. The last two bars in the chart predict temperatures of 51º and 50º respectively, but the bar
                showing 50º
                is shorter than the bar showing 51º. Another issue with this chart is that both the bars for the 11 and the
                1pm hours
                are not labeled. Similarly, only some of the bars have predictions for oncoming rain. </p>

            In redesigning this visualization, we tried to improve upon the truthfulness and beauty of the bar chart while still
            presenting the same data. We chose to maintain the basic bar chart structure in our redesign because we wanted the
            temperatures at different times to be easy to lookup and compare. A bar chart is well-suited for these functionalities.
            Some notable differences between our redesign and the original design are with the axes. In the original, there was no
            y-axis and the bars were instead just labeled with their numeric temperature data attribute. We chose to add a y-axis
            showing the temperature. Thus, for the value attribute of temperature, we encoded it using a line mark and the vertical
            spatial position channel to encode this quantitative data. This improves on the original because the original had bars
            of varying heights that we misleading (i.e. lower temperatures had higher bars). Additionally, in the original, the
            title implied that the chart showed the hour by hour forecast while in fact it actually used a single bar to represent
            every two-hour period. We changed this so that the categorical data was hourly. We encoded this categorical attribute of
            the hour using the horizontal spatial position channel .Instead of using an icon and a number to encode the chance of
            precipitation, we used a color gradient to encode that information. The lighter bars represent lower chance of
            percipitation and the darker bars represent a higher percent chance.
            A different redesign option that we did not chose but did consider was to display this information on an image of a
            clock. The temperature and chance of precipitation would then be encoded as icons with labels in each section of the
            clock. While this visualization may have looked more interesting than the bar chart that we chose, we decided that the
            purpose of the visualization was ultimately to give people an idea of what the temperature would be at each time of day
            and how it was going to change throughout the day. We wanted it to be easy for people looking at the visualization to
            look at it and be able to easily tell the temperature and likelihood of precipitation for that hour and we believed that
            the bar chart would provide that functionality the best even if it did not look as visually interesting.

                <p>The original version of this visualization is meant to display how each Major League Baseball team ranks for
            specific hitting and pitching statistics. Using the channel of length for its point/line marks as a way to
            display these rankings. The longer the line the higher the team is ranked for that specific stat.
            The visualization compares ten statistics for hitting, and ten statistics for pitching, displaying these
            lines in a circle. The pitching and hitting statistics are separated based on color, with blue being hitting
            and pink being pitching -- taking use of a color channel. While the visualization may be interesting to look
            at (taking advantage of the beauty aspect), it is actually ineffective and not functional in truly comparing
            teams. By looking at the visualization, it is hard to compare teams side by side -- the teams are even sorted
            alphabetically rather than by winning percentage. Using this visualization we are not able to get the full
            picture as to which team is performing best. </p>

        <p>In our new visualization we created a spider graph. In this visualization, we created two separate graphs,
            one for hitting statistics and one for pitching statistics -- this way we can compare these statistics on
            their own. Each corner on the graph represents a different statistic. We also included a filter which would
            allow us to select the teams we want to compare. For our marks we are utilizing points to indicate the
            rankings for each statistic, and areas to indicate the overall performance of the team as a whole, taking into
            account all of the statistics. In terms of channel, we use a color channel to encode different teams, and
            an area channel to show overall performance of a team.

            Our new visualization makes it easier to make direct comparisons between teams, increasing its
            functionality compared to the original visualization. By looking at the area of the graph we can
            determine which team has the best statistics. For example in our hitting chart we see that Team 1 has a
            higher area than Team 2, indicating that Team 1 ranks higher in its statistics and theoretically is the
            better team.

        <p> The original design as seen above is not an effective method of representing any sort of COVID-19 data.
            Alabama Public Health released this graphic towards the middle of May, and it is clear to see they do not
            utilize any channels other than colors. The colors are each assigned to a separate category, with red
            attached to
            “Laboratory-confirmed cases”, green attached to “Total hospitalizations”, orange attached to “Total Tested”,
            and blue
            attached to “COVID-19 Deaths”. The data of the visualization is also completely unclear, as we do not know
            if these numbers apply
            to the entire Alabama population or per a certain subset of the population.

        Our newest visualization can easily improve this design. We will be using a heat map, in which the outline
        of Alabama
        will be separated by county lines in order to separate the numbers into a digestible amount. Additionally,
        we will be
        starting with a new data field in which we track the average weekly cases per 100,000 people. Having this as
        the main filter
        will allow for the enlightenment of the COVID-19 situation to be seen. If viewers can see that daily cases
        are decreasing, they
        will feel not only enlightened with information, but much more hopeful for the future of their state. We
        will incorporate a filter in order to s
        witch between the various other categories, such as “Deaths”, “Laboratory Confirmed Cases”, etc. The main
        mark in our visualization will be the lines
        representing the counties, helping to increase the clarity of the visualization for the view. For our
        channel, we will be utilizing a color gradient in order
        to show the difference in numbers, for example in “Average daily cases per 100,000 people in the past week”.
        The gradient includes number markings in order to
        offer baselines for interpreting the gradient.
